ProductDifferentiation

How is my product different from pdf escape ?

1. LEarning focussed functionalities as below,

33+22=? . 55=Black
44+?=? . Shoe and hair is of the same color.

2. Online test taking.

Click on it, produce help text, then fill the answers.
Score it online, Publish reports then and there. Help teachers gather score easily.

3. Fool proof mechanisms.

Say when trying to click on a dark area or say name , then a text shows up saying.

"Hey you cannot put numbers here, child will not be able to read it."

4. Pre-filled templates.

Say a basic dora diagram with numbers filled. Users can click on existing numbers to edit it ,
 rather than to start from scratch.

 5. Auto update legends

 Say Shoe and Hair are to be of the same color black. Then Legend says 55=black.

 On Shoe, 11+44=?, on hair 22+33=? 

 If the numbers are edited to 11*3, then the legend automatically changes to 33=black.
